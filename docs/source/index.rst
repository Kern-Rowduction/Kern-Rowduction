Kern Rowduction
===============

| A ready-to-use package to increase the quality of your data by deleting near-duplicates in your data set. 
| This is possible by converting your data set into an oriented graph and extract its quasi-kernel which will represent your reduced data. 
| Using the reduced data instead of your original data will improve the computational & statistical performance of your machine learning algorithm.    

| Release date: 12 October 2021
| Version: 0.0.1

| Support for Python 3.6.9 at least.
