Who is Kern Rowduction for ?
----------------------------

The potential audience for Kern Rowduction includes mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and social scientists, 
notably if they're using machine learning techniques and/or imbalanced datasets. 

Goals
-----

- Increase the quality of a data set
- Reduce datasets and computational time / cost
- Undersample imbalanced datasets and over represented cohorts
- Improve statistics and predictive models' performances

Use Cases
---------

- Rebalance the population of 0 and 1 in a binary classification on a imbalanced population with a too large number of 0 by example
- Undersample over-represented classes for multi classification
- Reduce the influence of given ranges of values in the case of a regression
- Reduce the size of datasets without losing its 'significant' values in order to improve computational time / cost
- Improve feature engineering and machine learning models in general 

Background
----------

The first public version of this package was released in 2021 by Hamza Bouanani & Hichem Boughattas.
